## Description

This application is a test of your JavaScript fundamentals. The test lasts either 60 seconds or until all available questions are answered.

Answering a question incorrectly subtracts 5 seconds from the available timer. Answering a question correctly adds a +1 to your score.

When the test is finished you can enter your initials and your initials plus your score will be logged to local storage and displayed in the top left corner of the screen, allowing you to keep track of your historical high scores as you take the test multiple times.
